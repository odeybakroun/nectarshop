Login Information

When logging into the application, you must enter the following credentials exactly as shown (because the application uses a fake API for testing purposes):

email: emilys
password: emilyspass


📌 Important Note:
Email validation has been disabled because the fake API does not require a real email format.
Instead, it only accepts a simple username as the "email" value.
